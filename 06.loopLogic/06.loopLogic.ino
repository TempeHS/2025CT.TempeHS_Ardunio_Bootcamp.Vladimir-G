  Learning Intention:
  The students understand loop logic and apply it to a range of control structures.
  
  Success Criteria:
    1.  I understand logic Logic is asking questions and based on the true and false answer repeating 
        or not repeating something
    2.  I can apply different comparison operators to get a desired outcome in a count and pre-test loop
        control structure 
    3.  I can read a simple logic flowchart
    4.  I know how to find the documentation for loop logic control structures

  Student Notes: 
  Comparison Operators
    - != (not equal to)
    - < (less than)
    - <= (less than or equal to)
    - == (equal to)
    - > (greater than)
    - >= (greater than or equal to)

    Boolean Operators
    - ! (logical not)
    - && (logical and)
    - || (logical or)
