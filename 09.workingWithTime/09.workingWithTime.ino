  Learning Intention:
  The students understand how time is used in microcontrollers and best practices
  
  Success Criteria:
    1.  I understand why delay(1000) whilst easy is not the preferred way of time event management
    2.  I can use the millis() method and binary logic to trigger events by time
    3.  I can explain the difference and benefits in serial monitor plotting by using millis() compared to delay()
    4.  I understand how time can be used to send a communication frequency by using micros()
